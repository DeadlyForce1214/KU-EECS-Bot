The tar command is useful in being a means of compressing files (or directories) into a single file. 
The means of this is by tar [options] [archive-file] [file or directory to be archived]

**Options:**
``-c`` : Creates Archive
``-x`` : Extract the archive
``-f`` : creates archive with given filename
``-t`` : displays or lists files in archived file
``-u`` : archives and adds to an existing archive file
``-v`` : Displays Verbose Information
``-A`` : Concatenates the archive files
``-z`` : zip, tells tar command that create tar file using gzip
``-j`` : filter archive tar file using tbzip
``-W`` : Verify a archive file
``-r`` : update or add file or directory in already existed .tar file
``-z`` : compress the archive with gzip

Note: If it is just a .tar file, you do not need the -z option!

Examples we should know:
**Archiving:**
``tar -czvf [archive-file.tar.gz] [source files]`` --Sends the source files into the archive file with .gz compression
``tar -cvf [archive-file.tar] [source-files]`` --Sends the source file into the archive file without .gz compression

**Extracting:**
``tar -xvf [archive-file.tar] [source-destination]`` --Extracts to the source file, without decompression by .gz
``tar -xzvf [archive-file.tar] [source-destination]`` --Extracts to the source file, with decompression by .gz

**Viewing contents:**
``tar -tvf [archive-file.tar]`` --Views the contents of the tar file without extracting it.

For more help, you can always run the ``man tar`` command in a linux command line!
