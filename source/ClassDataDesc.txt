<EECS 888>Internet Routing Architectures
A detailed study of routing in IP networks. Topics include evolution of the Internet architecture, IP services and network characteristics, an overview of routing protocols, the details of common interior routing protocols and interdomain routing protocols, and the relationship between routing protocols and the implementation of policy. Issues will be illustrated through laboratories based on common routing platforms. Prerequisite: EECS 745. LEC.

</EECS 965>

<EECS 983>Resilient and Survivable Networking
Graduate research seminar that provides an overview of the emerging field of resilient, survivable, disruption-tolerant, and challenged networks. These networks aim to remain operational and provide an acceptable level of service in the face of a number of challenges including: natural faults of network components; failures due to misconfiguration or operational errors; attacks against the network hardware, software, or protocol infrastructure; large-scale natural disasters; unpredictably long delay paths either due to length (e.g. satellite and interplanetary) or as a result of episodic connectivity; weak and episodic connectivity and asymmetry of wireless channels; high-mobility of nodes and subnetworks; unusual traffic load (e.g. flash crowds). Multi-level solutions that span all protocol layers, planes, and parts of the network will be systemically and systematically covered. In addition to lectures, students read and present summaries of research papers and execute a project. Prerequisite: EECS 780; previous experience in simulation desirable. LEC.
